# Coding style

* Use double quotes (`"`) and triple-double quotes (`"""`) for strings unless there is reason to avoid having to quote these inside
* Follow something close to the [Google Python Style Guide for docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings). Use `Arguments:` not `Args:` however, and triple greater-thans (`>>>`) for code examples.
