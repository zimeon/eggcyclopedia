# Photos of eggs

## Naming convention

Each photo is a file with name `egg_{usda-species}_{#}{view}.jpg`, where:

  * usda-species is the USDA species name in English, all lowercase with underscores instead of spaces, e.g. `quaking_aspen`
  * # is the number of the egg or set of photos of an egg taken at different times or with different setups, starting with 1
  * view is a, b, c etc. for different views in the same sequence. Usually the a view will be side, long axis left to right, pointy end right, with the burnt species name showing; b will be side without burning; and c will be en end view

For example: `egg_quaking_aspen_1a.jpg`
